title: Manual Order Entry
---

An order can be created one of two ways: 

1) A customer generates an order when they purchase something from your store.
2) An order can be created manually from the Admin Dashboard for your store. 

This guide covers scenario #2 - how to create a manual order from the Admin Dashboard. 

## Add Products

To create a new order for your store, go into the Admin Dashboard, click the **Orders** tab, and click the **New Orders** button.

Type the name of the product you would like to add to the order in the search field. A list of product and variant combinations will return in the drop down menu. Select the product/variant option you want to add to the order as well as the quanity for that item. Then click the **Add** button to add it to the order. Follow the same steps to add more products to the same order. Click **Update* once you have added the desired items to the order.

## Customer Details

Next, enter the customer's billing address and shipping address for the order. If the order is for an existing customer, you can search for the customer in the **Customer Search** field. $$$Customer data isn't being returned for existing customers in the Sandbox$$$ If the order is for a new customer, then enter that person's billing and shipping address in the fields provided.

## Adjustments

The Adjustments page will appear showing the addtional charges above and beyond the product price that are applicable for the order. Typically this includes shipping costs and taxes. Click the **Edit** button next to either of these items to modify these charges. Click the **Delete** button to delete either of these charges. You can also manually enter an additional charge by cliking on the **New Adjustments** button.
